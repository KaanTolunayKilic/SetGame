A Card has 4 different attributes, where each of them has 3 characteristics:

* Color (e.g. red, blue and green)
* Shape (e.g. triangle, circle and rectangle)
* Fill (e.g. stroke, stripe and full)
* Amount (e.g. one, two and three)

E.g. Shape could be a triangle, circle or rectangle. It could be any shape as long as there are exactly 3 different shapes. The Player is able to select three cards on the field. These cards have to be a set. A set is combination of three cards, where either each attribute has the same or completly different characteristics.
